Calculation of highly variable genes was not selected but no precomputed set was detected in the dataset so doing it anyway using method 'seurat_v3'
Filtered out 21611 genes that are detected 30 counts (shared).
Normalized count data: X, spliced, unspliced.
Extracted 2000 highly variable genes.
Logarithmized X.
